c) print string with corresponding frequency. +
d) Merge Two arrays
e) reverse whole string not a single word of a string like “I.like” = “like.i” +

f)– 2 Coding Questions +
– Fibonacci Series
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Condtions:

If the n value there in the series print the n value +

Else – print sum of even number less than that n value in the series

Input: 21 output: 21

Input: 20 output: 10

Maximum Difference
You are given an array 'ARR' of the 'N' element. Your task is to find the maximum difference between any of the two elements from 'ARR'.
If the maximum difference is even print “EVEN” without quotes. If the maximum difference is odd print “ODD” without quotes.
For example:
Given 'ARR' = [1, 10, 5, 2, 8, 1 ] , answer is "ODD". Here the maximum difference is between 10 and 1, 10 - 1 = 9

Fibonacci Member
Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.
Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Count characters
Write a program to count and print the total number of characters (lowercase english alphabets only), digits (0 to 9) and white spaces (single space, tab i.e. '\t' and newline i.e. '\n') entered till '$'.
That is, input will be a stream of characters and you need to consider all the characters which are entered till '$'.
Print count of characters, count of digits and count of white spaces respectively (separated by space). +

Reverse Words in a String
You are given a string of length N. You need to reverse the string word by word. There can be multiple spaces between two words and there can be leading or trailing spaces but in the output reversed string you need to put a single space between two words, and your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces. +

Print Right Angle Triangle in Single Loop
Max difference between two elements of array.
And etc.

Find 2 maximum elements without sorting an array Find the new array that contains duplicate elements you have to return new array which does not have a single elements without using set

print string without taking repeating characters eg helper - helper

You need to perform Sorting in linked list

round 1 has questions based on Loops and pattern questions. round 2 consist of questions based on Linked-List, Sub-sequence, Binary conversion.

Explain the steps involved in the data analysis process. What is the difference between a left join and an inner join in SQL? How do you handle outliers in a dataset? Describe a situation where you had to clean or preprocess messy data. What techniques did you use?

1. If a number if a power of 7 2. clock problem

1. Find the kth highest element in an array. 2. Find the angle made by hour and minute at a given specific time. 3. Related to object sorting with a given scenario
