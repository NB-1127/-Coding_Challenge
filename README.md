# -Coding_Challenge


a) Sum of a digit of a number like 467=17
b) check whether string is unique or not.
c) print string with corresponding frequency.
d) Merge Two arrays
e) reverse whole string not a single word of a string like “I.like” = “like.i”

f)– 2 Coding Questions
– Fibonacci Series
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

Condtions:

If the n value there in the series print the n value

Else – print sum of even number less than that n value in the series

Input: 21 output: 21

Input: 20 output: 10

1)find minimum angle between hour and minute hand.
2)sort a binary array using one traversal and no extra space
3)2 given sum and we have to print all the subsequences in array with given sum
4)2 sort array of 0s and 1s in only one loop solution was using two pointers
5) Occurance of characters in string
6)Find the minimum number of coins to make a given value. (Coin Change)
7)Longest substring pallandrome in a string


Maximum Difference
You are given an array 'ARR' of the 'N' element. Your task is to find the maximum difference between any of the two elements from 'ARR'.
If the maximum difference is even print “EVEN” without quotes. If the maximum difference is odd print “ODD” without quotes.
For example:
Given 'ARR' = [1, 10, 5, 2, 8, 1 ] , answer is "ODD". Here the maximum difference is between 10 and 1, 10 - 1 = 9

Fibonacci Member
Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.
Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Count characters
Write a program to count and print the total number of characters (lowercase english alphabets only), digits (0 to 9) and white spaces (single space, tab i.e. '\t' and newline i.e. '\n') entered till '$'.
That is, input will be a stream of characters and you need to consider all the characters which are entered till '$'.
Print count of characters, count of digits and count of white spaces respectively (separated by space).

Reverse Words in a String
You are given a string of length N. You need to reverse the string word by word. There can be multiple spaces between two words and there can be leading or trailing spaces but in the output reversed string you need to put a single space between two words, and your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
